Abstract 

It is important for a bank to assess its credit risk and the extent of its exposure in the event of
non-performing customers. Statistical approaches have been used to estimate this type of risk for
decades, and with recent advances in the field of machine learning, there has been an interest
in seeing whether machine learning algorithms can achieve better risk quantification. The aim
of this study is to see which approach from a collection of machine learning techniques performs
the best in default prediction when model evaluation parameters are chosen. Logistic Regression,
Random Forest, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network were the techniques studied. To address
the imbalance between classes for the response variable, an oversampling technique known as
SMOTE was used. In order to enhance model accuracy, data was divided into clusters, followed
by the deployment of Machine Learning models on each of these clusters. In terms of the chosen
model evaluation metric, the results showed that XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning achieved
the best result. An attempt has also been made to simulate data in a pandemic environment and
the built-in model has been adjusted accordingly to assess credit risk.

The project can be divided into 3 sections -
